# Quality checks and measurement scope

The Gradle `check` lifecycle runs JUnit tests, Checkstyle on main/test sources,
SpotBugs on main/test bytecode and the scoped JaCoCo report. `build` includes
`check`. Mutation testing is a separate `pitest` task so ordinary feedback stays
fast; CI runs it after the build. All static findings fail their task: there is
no `ignoreFailures`, global suppression or baseline hiding existing warnings. Reviewed exceptions are exact bug-pattern/class/member matches in `config/spotbugs/exclude.xml`.
CI uploads test, coverage, mutation and static-analysis reports even after a
failed step.

## Pending-statistics checkpoint — November 6, 2026

Branch `feature/week6-finish`, based on merged main `ac70b3b` plus the progress
notes in `4baef67`; statistics code is `634b2c6`. Local `build pitest` exited 0 in 58 seconds on Gradle 9.7.1 /
JDK 17, with Java 11 compilation/tests. Remote CI for this checkpoint is pending
push; the earlier main CI result below does not verify these new changes.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Full team JUnit suite | **998 tests**, zero failures/errors/skips; includes 12 new adapter and 16 session-statistics cases. |
| Checkstyle / SpotBugs | Zero main/test findings after the existing reviewed exceptions; zero analysis errors/missing classes. No new exclusions. |
| Shared eleven-class JaCoCo scope | **2,353 instructions, 226 branches, 471 lines, 217 complexity counters, 104 methods, 11 classes**; zero missed counters. |
| PIT | **242/249 killed (97.19%)**, seven unchanged survivors; no uncovered/time-out/error mutants. Line coverage 472/472; 16 selected test classes, 1,523 executions across mutants. |
| New adapter / session | HandStatistics: 19 lines, 8 branches and 8 complexity counters covered; PIT 7/7 killed. SetupSession: 107 lines, 42 branches and 47 complexity counters covered; PIT 46/46 killed. |

The scope now includes the pending-statistics adapter. PlayStats itself, the
betting/state engine and Swing remain outside this metric denominator; their
tests and shared static checks still run. Counters do not prove independent
basis-path execution. The seven baseline survivors remain the six evaluator
cases and the unresolved hash-contract case reviewed below.

TDD first ran 28 new cases against the missing adapter/session connection:
25 failed and three existing zero-rate cases passed. All 28 passed after
implementation. Integration tests use real initialization, betting, adapter and
PlayStats, capturing observation deliveries and injecting failures before
mutation. No mock library, completed-hand totals or payout-dependent results
were added. See [BVA](bva/HandStatistics.md). Native focus/font walkthrough,
peer approval and new remote checks remain separate pending verification.

## Merged baseline — November 6, 2026

Verified main `ac70b3b` with `build pitest`: Gradle 9.7.1 on JDK 17 and
Java 11 compilation/tests. The local run exited 0 in 1 minute 19 seconds;
log: `/private/tmp/current-progress-check.log`. Its matching
[GitHub CI run](https://github.com/nu-cs-sqe/cs380-software-quality-engineering-20262701-course-project-group-16/actions/runs/42232032730)
also completed successfully.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Full team JUnit suite | 970 tests; zero failures, errors or skips. |
| Checkstyle / SpotBugs | Zero main/test unexcluded findings; zero analysis errors or missing classes. |
| Shared ten-class JaCoCo scope | 2,216 instructions, 216 branches, 438 lines, 204 complexity counters, 96 methods and ten classes; zero missed counters. |
| PIT | 237 generated, 230 killed, seven survived (97.05%); no uncovered, time-out or error mutants. PIT line coverage 439/439; 14 selected test classes and 1,436 executions across mutants. |

These scoped metrics include InitialDeal and the shared application session/view,
not the whole betting/state/statistics engine or Swing. They do not prove
independent basis-path execution. The seven survivors are the six evaluator
cases and hash-code contract case documented below. Earlier branch measurements
are preserved as history. The pending-statistics checkpoint above is newer.

## Reproduce

Gradle 9.7.1 requires a runtime JDK of at least 17; this computer uses JDK 17,
and CI installs JDK 25 plus the JDK 11 compilation/test toolchain. The Java
sources and tests still compile/run with Java 11. SpotBugs explicitly uses the
Gradle runtime JDK to analyze that Java 11 bytecode. Checkstyle 10.26.1 can run
on the project's Java 11 toolchain.

```sh
bash ./gradlew --no-daemon build
bash ./gradlew --no-daemon pitest
```

On CI the commands also pass
`-Porg.gradle.java.installations.fromEnv=JAVA_HOME_11_X64,JAVA_HOME` so both
installed JDKs are discoverable. Reports are under:

| Tool | HTML | Machine-readable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JUnit | `build/reports/tests/test/index.html` | `build/test-results/test/TEST-*.xml` |
| Checkstyle | `build/reports/checkstyle/{main,test}.html` | sibling `.xml` files |
| SpotBugs | `build/reports/spotbugs/{main,test}.html` | sibling `.xml` files |
| JaCoCo | `build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html` | `build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.xml` |
| PIT | `build/reports/pitest/index.html` | `build/reports/pitest/mutations.xml`, `linecoverage.xml` |

## Pinned tools and rules

| Component | Version | Compatibility basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JaCoCo | 0.8.15 | Gradle's documented version; supports modern runtime instrumentation. |
| PIT Gradle plugin | 1.19.0 | Released with Gradle 9 support and JDK 17 minimum. |
| PIT engine | 1.22.1 | Default engine of plugin 1.19.0, explicitly pinned. |
| PIT JUnit 5 plugin | 1.2.3 | Requires PIT 1.19.4 or later; discovers this project's Jupiter tests. |
| Checkstyle | 10.26.1 | Java 11 compatible 10.x line, deliberately avoids newer JDK-only versions. |
| SpotBugs Gradle plugin | 6.5.13 | Current stable release checked against the project wrapper. |
| SpotBugs engine | 4.10.2 | Explicit engine pin; runs separately from the Java 11 test process. |

Checkstyle's [Sun starter](https://checkstyle.org/sun_style.html) and
[Google starter](https://checkstyle.org/google_style.html) informed
[`config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`](../config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml).
The initial rules check naming, imports, braces, indentation, whitespace,
modifier order, fall-through, equals/hashCode pairing and source-file hygiene.
Indentation is four spaces, matching this repository; compact accessor/constructor methods remain allowed by the brace-placement rule. Mandatory Javadoc, import
ordering and complexity quotas are deferred until team agreement;
production Java has a 100-character line limit;
this is an explicitly adapted starter, not a claim of full Sun/Google compliance.
Tests use a separate `checkstyle-test.xml` retaining file/import hygiene,
type names, modifier checks and error-prone construct checks. Existing BVA IDs
such as `BP_01`, wildcard assertion imports and compact assertion tables are
accepted; method-name, import-star, indentation, brace-placement and whitespace
rules apply to production sources. This avoids a large unrelated reformat of
partner tests while retaining failing checks for actionable test mistakes.
SpotBugs uses maximum effort and includes low-confidence findings for review.

## Reviewed static-analysis exceptions

The first real main-bytecode run reported 13 SpotBugs findings. Each exception
below matches only its exact class, method/field and bug pattern; other findings
in these classes still fail. These are not metric exclusions.

| Exact location | Pattern / count | Review and reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `InitialDeal.random`, `GameSetup.dealerRandom` | `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` / 2 | Injected `Random` objects intentionally preserve caller-selected seeded/stub behavior. Copying would destroy the seam; these services are mutable and do not claim immutable/thread-safe ownership. |
| `BettingProgress.getPlayersToAct/getPlayersAllowedToRaise` | `EI_EXPOSE_REP` / 2 | Private helper validates then calls `Set.copyOf`; the returned sets are immutable. |
| `GameState.getCommunityCards/getPlayerStates/getRemainingDeck` | `EI_EXPOSE_REP` / 3 | Constructor helpers call `List.copyOf`; callers cannot mutate internal lists. |
| `GameView.getPlayers/getCommunityCards` | `EI_EXPOSE_REP` / 2 | Players use `Collectors.toUnmodifiableList`; community comes from the immutable state snapshot. |
| `PlayerView.getHoleCards` | `EI_EXPOSE_REP` / 1 | Constructor uses immutable `PlayerState.getHoleCards()` or `List.of()`. |
| `GamePanel.session/messages/humanViewers` | `SE_BAD_FIELD` / 3 | `JPanel` inherits serialization, but this live setup screen is never serialized; session/resources are intentional live runtime state. |

The immutable-collection contracts are also covered by existing state/view tests.
Revisit these matches if constructors, collection ownership or UI persistence
change. Shared Checkstyle violations are fixed in source instead of baselined.

## Scope and interpretation

SetupSession and SetupView include shared played-hand integration. The
current configured scope has eleven classes, including extracted InitialDeal
and the pending HandStatistics adapter.
Earlier nine-class results below are historical, not current full-game
coverage. PIT retains the renamed integration tests and the new session
and played-hand tests.

JaCoCo and PIT include `Card`, `Deck`, `PokerHandEvaluator`,
`ShowdownResolver`, `ShowdownResult`, `GameInitializer`, `InitialDeal`,
`HandStatistics`, `SetupSession`, `SetupView` and `Localizations`, including
their nested classes. `SetupView` remains in the scope
even though a display DTO could qualify for a view exemption: its private-card
filtering is useful behavior to measure. Tests exercise these components
through their public contracts; the complete JUnit suite also runs in the build.
PIT selects their focused domain/application tests plus deck-setup,
setup/showdown integration and localization-loader tests. PIT counts repeated
test executions across mutants separately from the JUnit suite count. It uses the standard `DEFAULTS` operator group, two
workers, HTML/XML output and deterministic report paths. A mutant may hang a
loop; timeout permits twice its baseline test duration plus two seconds.

Excluded from the **current eleven-class metric denominator**:

- Domain state, betting and PlayStats components; their test
  execution is retained, but their coverage is not established by this scope.
- `HandEvaluator`, an interface without executable default methods, and the
  `Rank`/`Suit` and nested `ShowdownResult.Status` enums, whose constants have no hand-written branching behavior.
- Swing `ui` classes and launch code, using the rubric's UI exemption; headless
  behavior tests still run and shared static analysis still checks those files.

The rubric's 100% cyclomatic-complexity coverage goal is distinct from 100% line,
instruction or branch coverage. [JaCoCo counters](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/counters.html)
report covered/missed complexity derived from branch coverage and do not prove
independent basis-path execution; exception edges do not count as branches.
Report every counter separately and review any missed paths. The mutation goal
is to kill every non-equivalent mutant. PIT's raw killed/total percentage does
not automatically remove equivalent mutants or justify survivors/timeouts.
There is no invented score threshold or forced green metric gate: actual
findings and rubric gaps must remain visible until assessed.

## Setup and result-component baseline (November 6)

Verified locally on **November 6, 2026**, on `feature/showdown-display`, after
merging main `e8c66ff` with the bilingual result-display component. This includes
the isolated tests and setup, null-handling and localization refactoring:

```sh
bash ./gradlew --no-daemon build pitest
```

Gradle ran on JDK 17; source compilation and JUnit execution used the JDK 11
toolchain. The command exited 0 in 55 seconds (15 actionable tasks,
14 executed and one up-to-date). Reports use the standard paths above;
local log: `/private/tmp/showdown-main-merge.log`.

- Full team suite: **764 tests**, zero failures, errors or skips. This includes
  18 bilingual result-display and 11 isolated initialization cases; the original
  16 initializer and 20 session cases remain real-component integration tests.
  The result panel is included in the team suite and static checks, while Swing
  remains outside Kevin's coverage/mutation denominator.
- Checkstyle: **0 main / 0 test violations**, including the new 100-character
  production line limit. This is an adapted style, not full Google/Sun compliance.
- SpotBugs: **0 main / 0 test unexcluded findings**, zero analysis errors and
  zero missing classes. The reviewed exact filters above remain explicit.
- Kevin-only JaCoCo, now **ten classes** including extracted InitialDeal:
  **1,856/1,856 instructions**, **182/182 branches**, **353/353 lines**,
  **167/167 complexity counters**, **76/76 methods**, **10/10 classes**.
  These are 100% counters, not proof of independent basis-path execution.
- PIT: **197 generated; 190 killed; seven survived**; raw score **96.45%**.
  Zero uncovered, timed-out, non-viable, memory-error or run-error mutants.
  PIT line coverage: **354/354** (its line counting differs from JaCoCo).
  It selected 12 test classes and ran 1,085 test executions across mutants.

| Kevin component | JaCoCo lines | Branches | Covered complexity | PIT killed / generated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Card | 11/11 | 6/6 | 8/8 | 7/8 |
| Deck | 18/18 | 8/8 | 9/9 | 8/8 |
| PokerHandEvaluator | 62/62 | 58/58 | 36/36 | 58/64 |
| ShowdownResolver | 36/36 | 20/20 | 14/14 | 16/16 |
| ShowdownResult | 9/9 | No branches | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| GameInitializer | 14/14 | 6/6 | 7/7 | 4/4 |
| InitialDeal | 31/31 | 8/8 | 10/10 | 14/14 |
| SetupSession | 28/28 | 6/6 | 15/15 | 11/11 |
| SetupView | 19/19 | 2/2 | 9/9 | 8/8 |
| Localizations | 125/125 | 68/68 | 54/54 | 59/59 |

Earlier branch checkpoints: the November 5 result-display build passed 753 tests;
the November 6 refactoring build passed 746. The combined suite above retains both.

Previous measurement (November 3): 735 tests; nine scoped classes; 319 lines,
184 branches and 153 complexity counters covered; PIT 178/186 killed with eight
survivors. Refactoring changes the denominators, so those historical values are
not current measurements. InitialDeal stays measured after extraction. All
197 component-baseline mutants are accounted for below; none was excluded to improve a score.

Existing localization fault-path fixtures cover missing/invalid resources,
IOException cause and stream closure, quoted braces/apostrophes, repeated or
reordered arguments, type compatibility and nested choice outputs. They still
pass after parser extraction. Native desktop focus and cross-platform layout
checks remain a separate manual team task.

## Mutation survivor review

The 197-mutant component-baseline `DEFAULTS` run retained seven survivors; none is hidden
by a PIT exclusion. The review below reasons about the published component contracts.
It does not change PIT's raw mutation score or prove literal output identity
for every public method.

| Mutant location | Count | Assessment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PokerHandEvaluator.bestFive`, outer `a/b/c/d` loop boundaries | 4 | Changing `<` to `<=` adds an iteration whose next nested loop is empty (`b=4`, `c=5`, `d=6` or `e=7`). No five-card candidate or result changes. |
| `PokerHandEvaluator.rankFive`, equal-count comparator branch forced false | 1 | Ranks enter the list in descending order. The alternative count comparator returns zero for equal multiplicities; Java's stable `List.sort` preserves their descending input order, producing the same group order. |
| `PokerHandEvaluator.score`, five-position loop boundary | 1 | The sixth iteration appends a zero base-15 digit because kickers have at most five entries. Every private score becomes exactly 15 times its previous value; all scores stay below 103 million, so no integer overflow or comparison-order change occurs. |
| `Card.hashCode`, integer return replaced by zero | 1 | Contract-preserving alternative, **not identical hash output**: a constant hash still satisfies equal objects having equal hashes. Different cards need not have distinct hashes. It can degrade hash-table performance; no hash-dispersion or performance requirement is currently specified. Acceptance of contract equivalence for this case remains pending. |

The six evaluator survivors are behaviorally equivalent under the current public
contracts; the hash-code survivor requires acceptance of contract equivalence
rather than literal hash-value equivalence. No artificial assertion of distinct hash codes was
added to inflate mutation kills. Consequently the raw score must remain below
100%, and the course's all-non-equivalent-mutants goal remains subject to this
review rather than an unqualified automated success claim.

## Earlier shared session follow-up — November 5, 2026

After integrating main with Estella's betting branch, local `clean build --continue`
and `pitest` pass on JDK 25 with Java 11 compilation/tests. The full suite is
**939 tests**, zero failures/errors/skips. Checkstyle reports0 main / 0 test
violations; SpotBugs reports0 main / 0 test unexcluded findings,0 analysis errors
and 0 missing classes. No exclusions or failing baselines were added.

The same nine-class measurement scope now includes shared session follow-ups;
it must not be attributed wholly to Kevin or treated as full-game coverage.
Current JaCoCo counts: **2,093 instructions,218 branches,392 lines,189 covered
complexity counters,80 methods,9 classes**, all with 0 missed. SetupSession
covers83/83 lines,44/44 branches and 41/41 complexity counters; SetupView covers
36/36 lines,2/2 branches and 19/19 complexity counters. These counters do not
establish independent basis paths or coverage of betting/state/statistics
classes outside the documented scope.

Current PIT: **227 generated,219 killed,8 survived**, raw **96.48%**. There are
no uncovered, timed-out, non-viable or run-error mutants. The selected 13 test
classes run 1,329 test executions across mutants; this is distinct from the 939
JUnit cases. PIT line coverage is393/393; its line denominator differs from
JaCoCo. The session's43/43 mutants and view's18/18 mutants are killed. The same
8 baseline survivors remain in the earlier review table, including the unresolved
hash-contract acceptance question; none is hidden or newly declared equivalent.

The first follow-up mutation run found two actionable gaps: checking the view's
20-chip preflop betting level, and concealing a revealed hand when playBotTurns
selects the human actor without executing a bot action. Both now have direct
behavior assertions. A separate actor-empty guard was redundant: session state
is published only after advancing closed rounds or producing a result; it was
removed rather than manufacturing invalid states to cover it. The explicit
fault/retry test verifies failed comparison does not publish the candidate or
append a duplicate action.

See the [local TDD record](tdd/week6-session.md) for RED/GREEN results and scope.
Headless English/Chinese played flows and offscreen startup/flop/result layouts
were checked. Native focus delivery and cross-platform fonts still require the
team's walkthrough. New remote CI and peer-review evidence remain pending push.


### Call-button layout regression — November 5

The later UI-only fix keeps the third action button visible when larger fonts
would otherwise wrap it below a fixed-height row. English/Chinese bounds and
label-fit tests extend the full suite to **941 passing tests**, with no
failures/errors/skips. Checkstyle and SpotBugs remain clean, without added
exclusions. The earlier mutation measurements are retained as historical
results; mutation testing was not rerun for this Swing-only layout change.

## Add tests and simplify initialization

InitialDeal is included in Kevin's coverage/mutation scope; moving work out of
GameInitializer did not remove it from the denominator. PIT includes both the
isolated coordinator tests and the renamed initialization/session integration
tests. All initialization/localization mutants are killed in this run. The old
extra-hand-allocation mutant is now killed because dealing traverses the actual
hand collection; an extra allocated seat changes the deal and fails integration
checks. This was a structural refactor, not a new user-visible requirement.


## Earlier PR15 reconciliation with main e8c66ff (November 6)

Full build: 952 tests, zero failures/errors/skips; Checkstyle 0 main / 0 test,
SpotBugs 0 main / 0 test unexcluded findings, zero analysis errors/missing classes.
The 100-character production rule is retained. No new suppression was added.

The shared ten-class scope includes InitialDeal and the shared session/view;
it is not a whole-game measurement. JaCoCo covers 2,216/2,216 instructions,
216/216 branches, 438/438 lines, 204/204 complexity counters, 96/96 methods and
10/10 classes. These counters do not prove independent basis paths. PIT
produces 237 mutants: 230 killed and 7 survivors (97.05%), with no uncovered,
timeout or error mutants. Its line coverage is 439/439. Fourteen selected test
classes ran 1,379 test executions in this run. The seven baseline survivors
are the six evaluator mutants plus the contract-preserving hash-code mutant
already documented above; the previous eight-survivor figure belongs to the
November 5 scope before the setup refactoring killed the allocation mutant.

A separate combined-source build includes the 18 ShowdownPanel cases from PR16:
970 tests and static checks passed at that earlier compatibility checkpoint.
The merged-history and CI verification are now recorded at the top of this file. The two result displays retain separate
resource keys because one formats a message plus settlement status and the
other formats winner names alone. Null-flow refactors, privacy/error states,
accepted-action logging and the visible Call button remain covered.
